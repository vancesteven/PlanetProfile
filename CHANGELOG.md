## [Unreleased] – genai branch

### Bug Fixes (narrow scope)
- **Corrected conduction profile added for clathrate depth calculation.** A new function `ConductiveTemperatureCorrect` in `PlanetProfile/Thermodynamics/ThermalProfiles/ThermalProfiles.py` implements the strict Turcotte & Schubert (2002) §4.9 eq. 4.40 form: `c1 = qTop·rTop²/k − Htot·rTop³/(3k)` with planar-limit ΔT = qTop·ΔR/k (Fourier's law). `GetPbConduct` now uses this function; the resulting clathrate layer thickness matches the user-specified `Bulk.clathMaxThick_m` (previously PP produced a clathrate 2× deeper than requested). Legacy `ConductiveTemperature` and `ConductiveTemperatureActual` retain their prior halved-c1 form to avoid disturbing silicate and ice-shell conductive profiles elsewhere in PP — see the module docstring and `FIXME 2026-05` markers in `Geophysical.py` for the known silicate boundary-condition issue scheduled for rework. The silicate-BC rework is non-trivial: for a solid sphere with prescribed qTop from the overlying ice shell, the c1/r term diverges near r=0 unless qTop = Htot·rTop/3 is enforced; PP does not impose this, and the legacy halved-c1 has been masking the divergence for years.

### Renames / Clarifications
- `Constants.triplePointT_K` → `Constants.TtripleIh_III_L_K` (with deprecation alias). Value unchanged at 251.165 K. The old name was misleading because the constant is the Ice Ih–III–liquid triple point, not the water Ih–liquid–vapour point at 273.16 K. Deprecation alias preserved in `defineStructs.py` for external scripts.

### Inference / MCMC
- **Test 50 upgraded to 8D MCMC with sampled basal temperature** (`Test50_mcmc_andrade_noocean_yao2014.py`). Adds `T_b ∈ [249.0, 250.965] K` as an 8th parameter; structure cache pre-built on a 9-point Tb grid; forward model linearly interpolates structures between bracketing grid points per sample. All ice-phase viscosity priors broadened to `[10, 16]` (log₁₀, Pa·s) to admit Petricca-style low-η regimes. Forward model adds a no-ocean safeguard rejecting any Ih cell whose interpolated T crosses the linearized melt curve. PPTest50 default clathrate cap reduced from 10 km to 2 km; PPTest50 default `Tb_K = TtripleIh_III_L_K − 0.2 K`.

## [3.1.0] – 2026-01-13
**Author:** @Chang-Scott

### Optimizations
- Improved memory usage in the EOS framework.
- Implemented EOS pre-loading to support large-scale explorations.
- Updated computational pathways to reduce typical PlanetProfile runs to ~1–5 seconds.

### Plotting Extensibility
- Overhauled storage of large-scale exploration results, enabling:
  - Exploreograms to utilize inductogram plots.
  - Inductograms to utilize exploreogram results.
- Exploration data is now saved and reloaded as `.pkl` files instead of `.mat`.
  - `.mat` files are still generated for users who wish to post-process results in MATLAB.

### Monte Carlo
- Added an initial framework to enable Monte Carlo sampling of model properties.
- See individual commits for implementation details.
- *Note:* Monte Carlo functionality is a work in progress and has not yet been extensively tested.

### Non-Self-Consistent Modeling
- Established a framework to support layer modeling with prescribed constant properties rather than EOS-derived values.
  - For example, users can now directly specify ocean density, thermal expansivity, and related parameters without enforcing compositional self-consistency.
- *Note:* This functionality is a work in progress and has not yet been extensively tested.

### MgSO₄–SeaFreeze Coupling
- Implemented dynamic coupling between ice polymorph chemical potentials and MgSO₄ thermodynamic data to generate phase grids on the fly.
- This replaces the previous approach that relied on precomputed MgSO₄ phase lookup tables, which were:
  - Low resolution.
  - Memory intensive.

### Bug Fixes
- Numerous bug fixes addressing edge-case planetary configurations and plotting-related errors.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-05-01
**Author:** @Chang-Scott

This release implements a broad set of changes developed over the past year, with several major new scientific and modeling capabilities.

### Major Additions
- Added the ability to model an **NaCl ocean** using an in-development NaCl(aq) Equation of State from **SeaFreeze**.
- Introduced support for **speciated ocean chemistries** (*CustomSolutions*) using the **Frezchem** and **SUPCRT16** databases, adapted through the chemical modeling package **Reaktoro**.
- Enabled calculation of **chemical (metabolic) reaction affinities** up to **1 GPa** using the **SUPCRT16-organics** database via **Reaktoro**.
- Integrated **PyALMA3** (the Python implementation of **ALMA3**) to compute **tidal Love numbers**.

### Expanded Ocean Chemistry Support
- These updates extend ocean world modeling beyond the previously supported:
  - Seawater
  - MgSO₄
  - Pure H₂O  
- PlanetProfile can now explore a substantially broader and more realistic geochemical parameter space.

### Documentation and Usage
- Guidance on using the **CustomSolution** capability is available upon request.
- A dedicated **PlanetProfile tutorial webpage** is currently in development.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed numerous incidental bugs across modeling and analysis workflows.
