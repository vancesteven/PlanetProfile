        based on Deschamps and Sotin (2001): https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JE001253
        Note that these authors solved for the scaling laws we apply in Cartesian
        geometry and for the case of zero internal heating within the ice shell.
        These are poor assumptions for thick ice shells and where significant
        tidal heating occurs in the ice shell. Strictly speaking, we use values
        for parameters such as the "mid" pressure that are not consistent with
        the equations of Deschamps and Sotin (2001), and several of their equations
        are poorly described, contain errors (e.g. unit problem in Eq. 2), or use
        physically inconsistent values, as in defining the "core" Rayleigh number Ra.
        A more robust model for convection in the ice shell should be found and
        used to replace this.
