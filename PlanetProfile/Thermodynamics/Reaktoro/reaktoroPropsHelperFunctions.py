def pressure_constraint(P_MPa, aqueous_species_list, speciation_ratio_per_kg, database, dP = -1):
    Find the pressure constraint at which Reaktoro can find equilibrium for the given speciation and database. Starts at P_MPa and checks if rkt can find equilibrium
        with a temperature of 273K. If it cannot, then adjusts P_MPa by dP and tries again, continuing this process until a compatible P_MPa is found.
        If we are looking for upper pressure cosntraint (dP is negative), then we stop also if it reaches <= 1.1 MPa, which Rkt should be compatible with.
    Args:
        P_MPa: Initial pressure constraint in MPa
        aqueous_species_list: String that has all species names that should be considered in aqueous phase
        speciation_ratio_per_kg: Dictionary of active species and the values of their molar ratio (mol/kg of water)
        database: Database to find pressure constraint for
        dP: The amount to change P_MPa by if equilibrium is not achieved. Defaults to -1 (for upper constraint)

    Returns:
        P_MPa: New pressure constraint in MPa for given database.
